# RetroMCP

**Turn your AI assistant into a RetroPie expert that learns your specific setup.**

RetroMCP bridges the gap between modern AI assistants and retro gaming by making your Raspberry Pi's RetroPie system accessible to AI helpers like Claude. Instead of spending hours troubleshooting controller issues, hunting down missing files, or configuring emulators, you can simply ask your AI assistant for help in natural language.

## The Problem This Solves

**Retro gaming on Raspberry Pi is amazing but can be frustrating:**
- Setting up controllers often requires specific drivers and configuration files
- Different emulators need different BIOS files, but which ones?
- Performance tuning requires knowledge of arcane configuration files
- Troubleshooting usually means diving into Linux command line and forums
- Every setup is slightly different, making generic guides unhelpful

**Traditional solutions require you to:**
- SSH into your Pi and run complex commands
- Navigate unfamiliar Linux file systems
- Edit configuration files by hand
- Remember (or re-learn) which packages and settings work for your specific hardware

## The RetroMCP Solution

RetroMCP turns your AI assistant into a knowledgeable helper that:
- **Connects directly to your Pi** - No manual SSH commands needed
- **Learns your specific setup** - Remembers your username, paths, and successful configurations
- **Speaks your language** - Ask questions like "Why won't my Xbox controller work?" or "Help me get N64 games running smoothly"
- **Provides expert guidance** - The AI gets full context about your system and can troubleshoot effectively
- **Adapts automatically** - Works with standard setups and custom configurations alike

## What is RetroPie?

[RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) is a popular retro gaming platform that turns your Raspberry Pi into a retro-gaming machine. It provides a user-friendly interface to run game emulators for classic consoles like NES, SNES, PlayStation, N64, and dozens more.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external systems through standardized server implementations. MCP servers expose tools and resources that AI models can use to perform actions on behalf of users.

## Overview

RetroMCP bridges the gap between AI assistants and RetroPie by providing MCP tools that enable:
- **Dynamic system discovery** - Automatically detects custom usernames and paths
- **Remote configuration** of RetroPie systems via SSH
- **Persistent system profiles** - Learns and remembers your specific setup over time
- **Automated setup** of controllers and emulators
- **System diagnostics** and troubleshooting
- **Package management** and updates

Instead of manually SSH-ing into your Pi and running complex commands, you can ask an AI assistant to help configure your RetroPie system using natural language. The system adapts to custom configurations (like using 'retro' instead of 'pi' username) and builds a knowledge base of your specific setup.

## Key Features

### üîç **Dynamic System Discovery**
- Automatically detects username (pi/retro/custom)
- Discovers RetroPie installation paths
- Identifies EmulationStation process type (systemd vs user)
- No hardcoded assumptions about your setup

### üìù **Persistent System Profiles**
- Learns your specific configuration over time
- Remembers successful tool executions and solutions
- Tracks controller and emulator configurations
- Stores profile in `~/.retromcp/system-profile.json`

### ü§ñ **AI Context Sharing**
- Exposes system profile via MCP Resources
- Claude gets context about your specific setup
- Enables more effective troubleshooting conversations
- Remembers past issues and resolutions

## Architecture

RetroMCP follows hexagonal architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business models and interfaces (ports)
- **Application Layer**: Use cases that orchestrate business logic  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: SSH implementations of domain interfaces
- **Discovery Layer**: Automatic system path and configuration detection
- **Profile Layer**: Persistent learning and context management
- **MCP Adapter**: Exposes functionality through the Model Context Protocol

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- SSH access to a Raspberry Pi running RetroPie
- Node.js (optional, for MCP Inspector testing)

## Installation

### 1. Enable SSH on RetroPie

On your Raspberry Pi:
1. Press F4 to exit EmulationStation
2. Run: `sudo raspi-config`
3. Go to "Interface Options" ‚Üí "SSH" ‚Üí Enable
4. Note your Pi's IP address: `hostname -I`

### 2. Install RetroMCP

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd retroMCP

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Configure Connection

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your Pi's details
nano .env
```

Required settings in `.env`:
```
RETROPIE_HOST=192.168.1.100  # Your Pi's IP address
RETROPIE_USERNAME=retro       # SSH username (auto-detected after first connection)
RETROPIE_PASSWORD=password    # SSH password
# OR
RETROPIE_SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_rsa  # Path to SSH key
```

**Note**: RetroMCP automatically discovers your system configuration on first connection, including custom usernames, RetroPie paths, and EmulationStation setup. The system adapts to your specific configuration without requiring manual path configuration.

### Code Quality

The project uses strict linting and formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix

# Format code
ruff format
```

All code must pass linting with zero errors before committing.

### Adding New Features

1. Define domain models in `domain/models.py`
2. Create interface in `domain/ports.py`
3. Implement infrastructure in `infrastructure/`
4. Add use case in `application/use_cases.py`
5. Wire up dependencies in `container.py`
6. Expose via MCP tools in `tools/`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify SSH is enabled on the Pi
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure credentials in `.env` are correct
- Test SSH manually: `ssh pi@<your-pi-ip>`

### Permission Issues
- Some operations require sudo access
- Ensure the Pi user has appropriate permissions
- Check RetroPie directory ownership

### MCP Inspector Issues
- Ensure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Update npm if needed: `npm install -g npm`
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
