# RetroMCP Specification

## Memory system + Refactoring
RetroPie System State MCP Tool - Functional Specification
Core Concept
An MCP tool that maintains persistent system state by storing/retrieving structured data about the RetroPie configuration, eliminating the need to rediscover system details each session.
Storage Strategy

Primary: JSON file on the Pi at /home/retro/.retropie-state.json
Backup: Optional cloud sync (Dropbox/Drive) for redundancy
Format: Versioned JSON schema with timestamp metadata

MCP Functions

retromcp:save_system_state() - Scan and persist current state
retromcp:load_system_state() - Return cached state data
retromcp:update_state_field(path, value) - Partial updates
retromcp:compare_state() - Detect configuration drift

Intelligence Layer
The tool should auto-detect changes by comparing current system state against cached state, flagging discrepancies for user review before updating.
Usage Pattern

First session: Full system scan → cache state
Subsequent sessions: Load cached state → quick diff check
After changes: Selective state updates

This creates a "memory" layer that bridges sessions while keeping the Pi as the authoritative source.RetryNBshould it be 4 separate functions or would one larger one be smarter ?EditOne function is architecturally superior.
A single retromcp:manage_state(action, params) function follows better design principles:
Why unified is better:

Single responsibility: State management is one cohesive concern
Consistent interface: Same authentication, error handling, file locking
Atomic operations: State reads/writes happen in controlled transactions
Future-proof: Easy to add actions like validate, migrate, backup

Function signature:
javascriptretromcp:manage_state(action, options)
// action: "load" | "save" | "update" | "compare" 
// options: { path?, value?, force_scan? }
Implementation benefits:

Shared state file locking prevents corruption
Common validation logic across all operations
Single point for schema versioning/migration
Easier to maintain transactional consistency

The principle here is that related operations should be grouped when they share core resources and concerns. State management is fundamentally about coordinated access to a single data structure - splitting it creates unnecessary complexity and potential race conditions.
Four separate functions would duplicate file handling, error cases, and validation logic across multiple entry points.

## Project Vision

RetroMCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to help users configure, troubleshoot, and manage RetroPie installations on Raspberry Pi. The focus is on system setup and configuration rather than game playing.

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Controller Setup
- **Problem**: User plugs in a new controller and it doesn't work
- **Solution**: AI detects controller type, installs required drivers, configures mappings
- **Example**: "I just plugged in my 8BitDo controller but it's not working"

### 2. Emulator Installation & Configuration
- **Problem**: User wants to play N64 games but emulator isn't set up
- **Solution**: AI installs emulator, configures performance settings, checks BIOS files
- **Example**: "Help me get N64 games running smoothly on my Pi 4"

### 3. System Troubleshooting
- **Problem**: Games are running slowly or system is overheating
- **Solution**: AI checks system stats, adjusts overclock settings, manages cooling
- **Example**: "My PSX games are stuttering"

### 4. Package Management
- **Problem**: Missing dependencies or outdated packages
- **Solution**: AI manages apt packages, RetroPie modules, and system updates
- **Example**: "Install everything I need for arcade games"

### 5. BIOS File Management
- **Problem**: Emulators need BIOS files but user doesn't know which ones
- **Solution**: AI checks required BIOS files and guides user on what's needed
- **Example**: "Why won't my PlayStation games start?"

## Technical Architecture

## Privilege Escalation Patterns ⚠️

RetroMCP uses **aggressive sudo privilege escalation** for RetroPie system management. This design decision follows the principle that RetroPie administration requires system-level access.

### Sudo Usage Strategy
```python
# Standard pattern for system operations
exit_code, stdout, stderr = self._execute_command(f"sudo systemctl start {service}")
exit_code, stdout, stderr = self._execute_command(f"sudo apt-get install -y {package}")
exit_code, stdout, stderr = self._execute_command(f"sudo rm -rf {path}")
```

### Tools with Elevated Privileges
1. **Service Management**: All systemctl operations use sudo
2. **Package Management**: APT operations (install/remove/update) use sudo
3. **File Management**: File operations (create/delete/copy/move/chmod) use sudo
4. **System Configuration**: System file modifications use sudo

### Security Considerations
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before sudo commands
- ✅ **Command Injection Prevention**: shlex.quote() applied to all user inputs
- ✅ **Error Sanitization**: Sudo output sanitized to prevent information disclosure
- ⚠️ **Privilege Level**: Requires passwordless sudo or stored credentials
- ⚠️ **Trust Model**: Assumes RetroPie system is dedicated gaming device

### Implementation Example
```python
# Management Tools - File Operations
def _manage_files(self, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[TextContent]:
    action = arguments.get("action")
    path = arguments.get("path")
    
    # Input validation happens here
    if not path:
        return self.format_error("Path is required")
    
    # Secure command execution with sudo
    if action == "delete":
        exit_code, stdout, stderr = self._execute_command(f"sudo rm -rf {path}")
```

This approach enables comprehensive RetroPie management while maintaining security through input validation and command injection prevention.
